## Things we've accomplished

### September 5th
* created a github repo
* developed project plan
* listed backlog items
* renamed .ipynb notebook

### September 12th
* Created docker image and a docker-compose file

### September 26th

Things we talked about:
• Adding a metric to the results of the output of the model.
• We attempted to save our model as a static file for use later. We ran into issues in using different versions of keras.

We cleaned some data, and did a git commit to show those changes in the repo. We retrained our model on our newly cleaned data.

TODO:
* Do a quick recap of our code
* First iteration of model improvement
 * one round of ranking
